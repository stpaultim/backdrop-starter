Config Batch Upload
===================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A proof of concept for the ability to upload a batch of config files that
would add a feature to Backdrop CMS.

At this early stage, this module adds a "recipe" tab to the configuration 
menu options. Users can upload a batch of configuration files through the
UI. The configuration files must be in tarball with tar.gz format.

There is no export feature at this time.
