INTRODUCTION
------------

Basic cart is a very simple shopping cart / checkout process for Backdrop,
that just sends 2 emails after each order. Along with the shopping cart,
this module also provides a block where you can view your cart's content.

You must add your own payment processor or service.

It's ideal for small websites with only a few products or other content types being sold, for example touristic offers.  It is much simpler to get started for simple or few products.

Features

* The possibility of choosing the content types that can be added to the cart.
* The possibility of sending, or not, an email to the customer once an order is placed.
* Custom email messages for both the site administrator and the customer, along with the order details.
* A block with the contents of your shopping cart.

Working in Backdrop 1.1

KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------

NOTE: I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF THE SIMPLE ORDER/RECORD KEEPING SYSTEM.  I wouldn't depend on it as is.
Hopefully in 8/2015 I can get this upgraded to a better Views system using https://www.drupal.org/project/charts

COMING FROM DRUPAL?
-------------------

Main difference from Ubercart and Commerce

The main difference from Ubercart and Commerce is the possibility of choosing
the content types that can be added to the cart. It also doesn't bother you
with the Product SKU, that can be a pain when you have just a few products.

Basic Cart for Drupal stored node objects in the user $_SESSION variable and used pre-made Views, Features, etc... The Backdrop port failed with this error because of it: Fatal error: Call to undefined function module_implements() in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/backdrop/core/includes/bootstrap.inc on line 3467 This happens when you add a product to the cart.

Basic Cart for Backdrop stores node id's as strings in the user $_SESSION variable and no pre-made etc...

PERMISSIONS

@todo


USAGE
-----

Install the module.

If the goods you want to sell don't exist on your website, create a new content type for them. If you already have a content type for them you can skip this step.

Select the content type/s on the module configuration page: Configuration - Basic Cart or admin/config/basic_cart/settings.

Create a view for the content type/s to get the shop's overview. If you already have it, you can skip this step.

You have a block with the cart preview. Activate it and place it in your layouts ;-)

Start to add you're products in the newly created content type or in the one you already have.
